Protocol definitions crate for RustySamovar game server
=======================================================
You can grab protocol definitions at [Sorapointa-Protos](https://github.com/Sorapointa/Sorapointa-Protos).
Place them into `protobuf` subdirectory. Don't forget to add `package Proto;` line to each of them. Look at `convert_protos.sh` script.
You'll also need some enum definitions, EnumDumper will help you with that.
